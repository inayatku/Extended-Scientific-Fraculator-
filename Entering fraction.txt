Title: Fraculator - Entering and Modifying Fractions

Introduction:
The Fraculator allows users to input and modify fractions in a multi-line display easily. In this document, we will discuss the procedure to enter new fractions and modify existing fractions.

Entering Fractions:

Always Start typing from middle (second) line of input screen. 

Method 1:
To enter a fraction in this calculator, you can use the division symbol (/) between the numerator and the denominator. Here's how to input a fraction:

1. Enter the numerator (the top number of the fraction) using the number buttons or by typing it directly.
2. Press the division button ("/") or type it using the keyboard.
3. Enter the denominator (the bottom number of the fraction) using the number buttons or by typing it directly.

For example, to enter the fraction 3/4:

1. Type '3' or press the number button '3'.
2. Press the division button ("/") or type '/'.
3. Type '4' or press the number button '4'.

The calculator will now display the fraction as "3/4" and you can perform calculations with it.

If you want to perform operations with fractions or display the result as a fraction, the calculator will automatically simplify the result when possible. For example, if you multiply 3/4 by 4/5, the calculator will display the result as "12/20" and then simplify it to "3/5".

Method 2:

1. Navigate to the location in the multi-line display where you want to enter the fraction.
2. Press the 'Tab' key to enter the fraction mode.
3. Type the numerator of the fraction.
4. Press the 'Tab' key again to move to the denominator.
5. Type the denominator of the fraction.
6. Press the 'Tab' key one more time to complete the fraction input. The fraction is now entered, and you can continue to input other expressions or perform calculations.

Modifying Fractions:
1. Use the navigation buttons or arrow keys to reach the location of the fraction you want to modify. Move the cursor to the numerator or the denominator as required.
2. Once the cursor is at the desired location, use the backspace key to delete any existing digits.
3. Type in the new values for the numerator or the denominator.
4. If you need to modify both the numerator and the denominator, follow the same process as described in steps 1 to 3 to move the cursor and update the values.

LIMITATIONS and CAUTIONS: 
1. In multi-line display of fraction, never use tab key during or after modification of a fraction. 
2. Do not use navigation arrow keys during entry of a fraction.

After entering or modifying the fractions, you can perform various calculations, and the calculator will handle them accordingly with the updated fraction values.

Conclusion:
This Fraculator provides an efficient way to enter and modify fractions in a multi-line display, allowing users to perform calculations with ease. Make sure to follow the steps outlined in this document to enter new fractions and modify existing ones as needed.
